# Codec_Benchmarks

The main goal is to provide an automated solution to benchmark coded

The idea would be :
- you gave the file , a config_file path for the codec config (.json) , a  
    - this would run the encoded.py with the config_file 
        - is has to be run only when one config parameters changes
            - like package redundancy and so on
